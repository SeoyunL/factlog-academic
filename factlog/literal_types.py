"""Deterministic normalizers for typed literal values.

A relation declared in ``policy/typed-relations.md`` carries a literal object
(a date, number, or ordinal). To let the deterministic engine order/compare such
values, each raw object string is parsed here into a **canonical sortable
scalar**. This module is **pure**: no engine, no I/O, no ``pyrewire`` import.

Contract for every parser:
- returns the canonical scalar, or ``None`` if the string does not parse as that
  type (the caller emits a warning and loads the fact untyped);
- never raises on bad input, and never guesses;
- reads **ASCII digits only** — a full-width/other Unicode digit does not parse
  (see the digits note below).

``amount`` (e.g. ``100억``, ``1,000원``) carries a **unit**, so it normalizes to a
declared **integer base unit** via a reviewable unit table (Korean monetary units
only in this first cut: ``원/천/만/억/조``). Amounts compare in integer base units;
a sub-base-unit fraction is rounded to the nearest int (ROUND_HALF_UP). The engine
has no float column, so the base-unit value MUST be an exact integer — see
``parse_amount``.

**Digits are ASCII-only (#388).** Every numeric group below is spelled ``[0-9]``,
never ``\\d``: Python's ``\\d`` matches the whole Unicode ``Nd`` category, so a
full-width ``date(２０２０,１)`` used to parse to the same scalar as ``date(2020,1)``
while the *stored object string* stayed different. That split one value in two
depending on context — a typed relation grouped the pair as equal (``_group_key``
keys on the scalar), an object-match query for the ASCII spelling missed the
full-width row, and without a typed declaration the two became separate entities.
The codebase normalizes to **NFC**, which preserves full-width digits (only NFKC
folds them), so nothing upstream collapses them either.

So a non-ASCII digit is **rejected**, not silently folded. The reason is the one
#388 gives, and it is a policy choice, not a claim of wider coverage: this
repository prefers an **explicit refusal over a silent fold** (``--category``
pre-validation, the silent-zero guard), and a full-width digit in a numeric field
is far more likely an **input accident** — a CJK source, a PDF conversion, an IME
left in full-width mode — than a value a human meant to write. Refusing makes the
accident *visible* at the point a human can still fix it.

Rejection is deliberately **narrow**, and does NOT make the value single-state:

- It only reaches values that go **through a parser**, i.e. objects of relations
  declared in ``policy/typed-relations.md``. A value under an **undeclared**
  relation never touches this module, so the full-width and ASCII spellings stay
  **two separate entities** — measured, unchanged from before this module was
  narrowed. That is a **residual symptom of #388 that this module does not fix**
  and cannot: nothing here is on that code path.
- The value the KB **stores** is untouched either way. Refusing to parse does not
  rewrite ``accepted.dl``; the full-width string is still what an object-match
  query has to match.

The place that *could* collapse all three symptoms at once is the **merge stage**,
where ``tools/merge_candidates.py``'s ``normalize_rows`` already rewrites the
stored object string **before** computing the dedup key (that is how
``canonical_amount`` folds ``amount(7,억)`` and ``amount(7,"억")`` into one row).
A digit fold placed there would change the stored string, so the dedup keys would
merge and the entity split would go with them. That is a **data rewrite**, a
different decision from this one, and it is not made here.

What rejection does buy is a **report**, and it now has **two visible exits for all
four types** (measured, post-#394): the value degrades to the ordinary "does not
parse" path and surfaces both at ``common.typed_projection_outcome``'s
``typed-relations`` projection warning and in ``entity_audit``'s ``malformed typed
literal`` section::

    _is_malformed_compound_term(v), no typed declaration
      date(２０２０,１)      -> True
      number(１２３)        -> True
      ordinal(３)          -> True
      amount(１００,"억")   -> True

``amount`` reached only the first exit until #394. ``_is_malformed_compound_term``
returned early for any compound ``amount`` under a relation with no ``amount``
spec, so a full-width amount was refused by this module yet invisible in the audit.
#394 narrowed that exemption to **unit resolution alone** and judges the shape
first, so a value whose ``num`` group fails is malformed with or without a
declaration — which is exactly the full-width case. Nothing in this module changed
for that to happen; the coupling is one-way, and ``entity_audit`` pins it.

Because a full-width digit is hard to see in a warning, the report sites append
``non_ascii_digits`` to name the actual offending characters.

**Expect a rise in these warnings after this lands, from one known producer.**
``zotero``'s ``extract_year`` passes a full-width year through verbatim (#398), so
an ordinary Zotero import can write a value this module now refuses; ``csl``'s
``_YEAR_RE`` folds one silently via ``int()`` and is the milder sibling (#399).
Neither is fixed here. If ``does not parse`` warnings appear on records nobody
hand-edited, #398 is the first place to look.
