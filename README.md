# factlog

> facts + logic — a Claude Code skill that turns markdown sources into **verifiable, source-backed facts**.
> The LLM extracts; a deterministic Datalog/wirelog engine verifies.

**Status:** stable release (`v0.1.0`).

> Not affiliated with the unrelated `tkf/factlog` Emacs file-access logger.

## What it is

factlog is a [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com) **skill** for keeping a markdown knowledge base honest. It follows one rule:

> The agent does not draw conclusions. The agent produces files and calls a CLI. The CLI returns a verifiable report.

- **The LLM (Claude, in-session) extracts** candidate facts from your `sources/`, drafts Datalog queries from natural-language questions, and attempts limited self-correction.
- **A deterministic engine (wirelog via [pyrewire](https://github.com/semantic-reasoning/PyreWire)) verifies** them — compiling confirmed facts, running the logic check, and surfacing policy findings, conflicts, and `review_required` items.

Anything the model produces is a *candidate* until the engine and a human confirm it.

## How it works

```
sources/        →  Claude extracts        →  facts/candidates.csv, pages/, decisions/
candidates       →  human review           →  confirmed facts
confirmed        →  compile (deterministic) →  facts/accepted.dl
questions        →  Claude drafts query     →  facts/query.dl
accepted + query →  wirelog logic check     →  facts/logic_report.txt   ← the verifiable report
review_required  →  Claude repairs (gated)  →  decisions/correction_trace.md
```

## Source file formats

`/factlog sync` extracts facts by reading each file under `sources/` **as text,
in-session**. The bundled engine (`merge_candidates.py`) tracks every file as a
source *path* but never parses contents — so a file is only ingested if its text
can be read during extraction. A binary original (e.g. `.docx`) therefore yields
no facts on its own.

| Format | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| `.md`, `.markdown`, `.txt` | **Directly supported** | UTF-8 text, read verbatim. This is what every extraction reference assumes. |
| Other UTF-8 text (`.rst`, `.org`, `.csv`, source code) | Supported as plain text | No special parsing; treated as raw text. |
| `.docx`, binary `.pdf`, `.odt`, `.epub`, `.html`, `.rtf` | **Auto-converted** | `factlog ingest` converts these to text via pandoc / textutil / pdftotext. |
| `.hwpx` (Hancom OWPML) | **Auto-converted** | Built-in extractor (no external tool) — reads the zip's `Contents/section*.xml` text. |
| `.hwp` (legacy Hancom, HWP 5.x) | **Auto-converted** | Via `hwp5html` (pyhwp) → pandoc → markdown, tables preserved. Needs `pip install pyhwp` + pandoc; if absent, reported with a hint. |
| `.pptx` (PowerPoint) | **Auto-converted** | Built-in extractor (no external tool) — reads on-slide text from the zip's `ppt/slides/slideN.xml`, slides in order, one block per slide. Speaker notes are excluded; table cells flatten to one line per cell (row/column grouping not preserved). |
| `.xlsx`, images | **Not converted** | No bundled converter — reported with a hint; convert by hand. |

`factlog ingest` writes the converted text into the KB's **`runs/sources/`**
directory (alongside the other generated run artifacts) — **never into
`sources/`**, which stays the user's originals. The original is left untouched
and the conversion carries a provenance header (source, converter, date). Both
`sources/` and `runs/sources/` are valid source roots that extraction reads.

```bash
factlog ingest report.docx --target ~/wiki   # → ~/wiki/runs/sources/report.md (pandoc)
factlog ingest --scan --target ~/wiki        # auto-convert every binary under sources/
```

### Active KB (target the set-up KB from anywhere)

After `factlog init`/`setup` (or `factlog use <kb>`), the chosen KB is recorded
as the **active KB**, so `ingest`/`ask`/`sync` and the tools target it from any
working directory — no `--target`/`--wiki` needed:

```bash
factlog use ~/wiki        # make ~/wiki the active KB (recorded in config)
factlog where             # show the active KB and how it was resolved
factlog sources           # list registered sources (original, conversion, fact count)
factlog status            # KB state: facts by status, vocabulary, conflicts, logic freshness, engine
cd /anywhere && factlog ingest report.pdf   # → ~/wiki/runs/sources/report.txt
factlog eject report.pdf  # inverse of ingest: remove the conversion + retire its facts
```

### Removing a source (`factlog eject`) — the inverse of `ingest`

`factlog eject <source>` undoes an ingest: it deletes the `runs/sources/`
conversion, strips the source's extracted rows from `runs/*.json`, and retires
the facts that cite it. Name a source by filename, stem, or KB-relative path —
naming the binary original (e.g. `report.pdf`) also matches its
`runs/sources/<stem>` conversion; a bare stem matches every source with that
stem.

```bash
factlog eject report.pdf                 # delete conversion; mark citing facts superseded (kept for audit)
factlog eject report.pdf --purge         # delete the citing candidate rows instead of superseding them
factlog eject report.pdf --delete-original  # also delete the user's original under sources/
factlog eject report.pdf --dry-run       # show the planned changes, modify nothing
```

By default the retired facts are marked `superseded` (kept in
`facts/candidates.csv` for audit) and the original under `sources/` is **kept** —
so it would be re-converted on the next `/factlog sync`; pass `--delete-original`
to remove it too. `accepted.dl` is recompiled so the engine input drops the
retired facts immediately.

A `runs/sources/` conversion is tied to the original that produced it via the
ingest provenance header, so even when two originals share a stem,
`eject report.docx` never disturbs `report.pptx`'s conversion. `pages/` are not
regenerated by `eject` — run `/factlog sync` to reconcile them. The default
`superseded` mark is a current-state retire: if you keep a **text** original
under `sources/`, the next `/factlog sync` re-extracts and re-asserts its facts —
to remove a source for good, pass `--purge` and/or `--delete-original`.

Resolution precedence: `--target`/`--wiki` flag > `$FACTLOG_ROOT` > active-KB
config (`${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-~/.config}/factlog/config.json`) > current directory.
With no config set, behavior is unchanged (uses the current directory).

`/factlog sync` runs `factlog ingest --scan` as its first step, so binaries you
drop in `sources/` are converted automatically (idempotently — unchanged files
are skipped). If a binary has no `runs/sources/` conversion, `merge_candidates.py`
warns so the silent non-ingestion is visible.

## Requirements

- Python **3.11+** (required by the engine dependency `pyrewire`)
- **pyrewire 1.0.1+** (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
- Claude Code CLI

## Install

factlog is a **Claude Code plugin**. Install it from this repo's marketplace in a Claude Code session:

```
/plugin marketplace add semantic-reasoning/factlog
/plugin install factlog@semantic-reasoning
/factlog setup                     # one-shot: deps + doctor + init, in-session
```

`setup` runs `doctor`, installs the engine dependency (`pyrewire`), scaffolds the KB, and re-checks the environment — in one command.

### Local install (development)

To develop against a local clone, register the working tree as the marketplace instead:

```
/plugin marketplace add ~/git/semantic-reasoning/factlog
/plugin install factlog@semantic-reasoning
```

### What `/factlog setup` does

`setup` collapses the previously-separate post-install steps into a single command. Equivalently, by hand:

```bash
pip install -r ~/git/semantic-reasoning/factlog/requirements.txt   # pyrewire>=1.0.1,<2.0
python3 -m factlog doctor          # checks Python 3.11+ and pyrewire
python3 -m factlog init --target ~/wiki   # scaffold the KB layout
```

If your Python is externally managed (PEP 668), pip will refuse to install into it; `setup` prints venv guidance instead of forcing the install. Create and activate a venv, then re-run `setup`:

```bash
python3 -m venv ~/.factlog-venv && source ~/.factlog-venv/bin/activate
python3 -m factlog setup --target ~/wiki
```

## Usage

In a Claude Code session inside your knowledge base (the plugin is active in every session):

```
/factlog sync      # read sources/, extract candidate facts, update pages & decisions
/factlog query     # translate policy/questions.md into facts/query.dl (Datalog query draft)
/factlog check     # compile accepted facts, run the logic check over accepted + query, show the report
/factlog repair    # attempt gated self-correction of review_required queries
/factlog ask       # answer one question: deterministically routed to the engine (verified) or wiki exploration (unverified)
```

Run `/factlog query` before `/factlog check`: the logic check evaluates the
query draft in `facts/query.dl`, which `/factlog query` produces from your
natural-language questions in `policy/questions.md`.

## Determinism & limitations

A skill is a prompt, so the model is *guided*, not *forced*, to run each step. factlog keeps every step that must be reliable — fact compilation, the wirelog logic check, policy compilation, validation — as **bundled scripts the skill is instructed to run and trust**, never as model judgment. The logic check report is always produced by the engine, never narrated by the model.

### AC4 — stale-edit guard (two levels)

factlog enforces freshness through two distinct mechanisms:

| Level | Mechanism | What it guarantees |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Hook-enforced** | `PreToolUse` hook denies any `Write`/`Edit` to `facts/accepted.dl` or `facts/query.dl` when `facts/logic_report.txt` is missing or older than those files (run `/factlog check` → `run_logic_check.py` to refresh) | The engine's compiled inputs cannot be overwritten when the logic report is stale — the hook blocks the tool call before the file is touched |
| **SKILL discipline (best-effort)** | `SKILL.md` instructs Claude to run `run_logic_check.py` and show `facts/logic_report.txt` verbatim before stating any conclusion | The model is *guided* to surface the engine report; it cannot be *forced* (R10: "cannot fully guarantee") — human review of the raw report is the final verification step |

These two levels are complementary: the hook closes the deterministic gap; the SKILL discipline covers the narration layer where engineering enforcement is not possible.
