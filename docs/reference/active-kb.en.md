# Active KB

## Active KB (target the set-up KB from anywhere)

After `factlog init`/`setup` (or `factlog use <kb>`), the chosen KB is recorded
as the **active KB**, so `ingest`/`ask`/`sync` and the tools target it from any
working directory — no `--target`/`--wiki` needed:

```bash
factlog use ~/wiki        # make ~/wiki the active KB (recorded in config)
factlog where             # show the active KB and how it was resolved
factlog sources           # list registered sources (original, conversion, fact count)
factlog status            # KB state: facts by status, vocabulary, conflicts, logic freshness, engine
cd /anywhere && factlog ingest report.pdf   # → ~/wiki/runs/sources/report.txt
factlog eject report.pdf  # inverse of ingest: remove the conversion + retire its facts
factlog ignore drafts/*.md   # exclude sources from sync (re-extraction)
factlog provenance Acme uses FastAPI   # trace a fact to its source(s)
```

Resolution precedence: `--target`/`--wiki` flag > `$FACTLOG_ROOT` > active-KB
config (`${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-~/.config}/factlog/config.json`) > current directory.
With no config set, behavior is unchanged (uses the current directory).
